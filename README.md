# Automated workflows

Materials for ACS 2019 talk on automated workflows for molecular
dynamics simulations, with emphasis on
[mdworks](https://github.com/Becksteinlab/mdworks) as an example for
complex molecular dynamics workflows with
[FireWorks](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/).

[MDPOW](https://github.com/Becksteinlab/MDPOW) is also mentioned as
an example for a simple linear workflow.

The importance of re-usable and robust **building blocks** (such as
[MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org),
[GromacsWrapper](https://github.com/Becksteinlab/GromacsWrapper),
[alchemlyb](https://github.com/alchemistry/alchemlyb)) and a **common
language** (Python) is stressed.
